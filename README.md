# 483ProcessMiningProject
Using medical data to generate a process model from pnml, visualize the petri nets through each thresholds.

Part 2:
Prediction of unplanned 30-day readmission of ICU patiens using process mining deep learning approach thorugh DREAM algorithm.
Changing # of layers in NN, activation function, and optimizer in our NN to see how it affects things.
